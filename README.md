# states-capitols-quiz

## Description

This program is a multiple choice quiz containing 50 questions for each state's capitol in the United States. When the program is opened, it will be in it's inital state, and will have a button for the user to start the quiz. Once the user starts the quiz, the user will be prompted with the first question. Each state is in alphabetical order. Each option for a response is a button that once clicked will automatically pull up the next question. The user cannot go back to the previous question. At the end of all 50 questions, the user's score will be stored to local storage, and will be visible after being pulled from local storage to display to an ID. 

In my process of learning Javascript, this application's purpose was to make me familiar with working with IDs, traversing the DOM, as well as introduce myself to local storage. All of those concepts are prevalent in this program, as it uses multiple methods create, remove, and append elements throughout the use of the program, as well as storing the score in local storage and getting the item from local storage at the very end to display a score. 

## Installation

No installation is required for this application.

## Usage

Open program and click button to prompt the first question. The first question will then display followed by four buttons for responses. If the correct response is clicked, that resonse will add to the score. This program will automatically move on to the next question no matter what response is clicked. At the end of all 50 questions, a score will then be displayed for the user to see. That score is also stored in local storage, which is accessible through the browser.
